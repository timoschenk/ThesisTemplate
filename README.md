# ThesisTemplate
A LaTeX documentclass based on article for a Master Thesis at Tinbergen Institute.
Inspired by the [Oxford Thesis Template](https://www.oxfordechoes.com/oxford-thesis-template/).
Adds one or two supervisors to the titlepage.
Check `example.tex` for a minimum example resulting in `example.pdf`.
